# Professional Readme Generator
 ![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-BSD%203-blue.svg)

## Description 
In this project I am using node packages with inquire and fs to create promptds for a professional readme generator. With this project I am to take away some of the mundane tasks incorporated with readmes and instead make them engaging, and easy to follow!
